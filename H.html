<p> Assalamualaikum Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø¯Ø±ÛŒ,
    I wanted to talk to you about something important. 
    See, First of All, i am 100% sure that you don't have any intentions of Being in a Haram Relationship in Future.
    But, Talking About Halal Relationship (And you know what that means, mai kehta but it is weird ðŸ˜„)
    So Talking About Halal Relationship, you have many choices, But let me tell you the things you could get benifit of, (if Allah Has written it for us).
    So, 
    1: You'll Get Islamic Environment, and we all know that real success is the success of Akhirah and it is achieved when you practice the Deen, and practicing is easy, when you get the right environment.
    
    2: Baki Kabhi Aur discuss karenge
    
    So, In our family, practicing deen and following Islamic principles is very significant. It's not just about my family's expectations, but also about my personal beliefs and the life I envision for myself and my future family.
    
    I've noticed a few things, like sometimes missing prayers and not always covering your face (even though you told me that you cover it outside of school, but today, i did not see what you said), which concern me. 
    I care about you and our potential Halal future together, but I also want to ensure we're both on the same page when it comes to our faith and practices.
    If these things continue, it will be challenging for us to move forward towards Halal, not just because of my family's expectations but also because of our responsibility towards our faith. 
    See, if it continues, we both are in Loss, but the thing is i will experience Dunyawi Loss, and you will experience Eternal Loss.
    I will experience Dunyawi loss, because i will lose someone special.
    But , you will experience Eternal Loss because You may not make it to the REAL SUCCESS (only, if it continues(according to quran ans hadith).
    
    I believe that if we work on these aspects together, it will benefit both of us in this life and the hereafter.
    I hope you understand where Iâ€™m coming from and we can discuss this further. Thanks for listening.
    Take Care</p>
